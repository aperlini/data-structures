# Stack (LIFO)

> In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:
	•	Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
	•	Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without modifying the stack [...] A stack is needed to implement depth-first search. [^1]

## Basic structure 

to be completed...

## We should be able to : 

1. Push an item to the collection
2. Pop : remove the most top item in the collection
3. Peek : access the top item 
4. Check if stack is empty
5. Print the collection 

## Implemented

- [x] Push
- [x] Pop
- [x] Peek
- [x] isEmpty
- [x] printStack
