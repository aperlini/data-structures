# Linked-list

> A linked-list is a collection of structures ordered by [...] logical links that are stored as part of the data in the structure itself. [...] Every structure has a data field and an address field. The Address field contains the address of its successor.[^1]

## Basic structure 

**Nodes** are linked in a linear structure

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	10 --> 11 --> 12 --> 15 --> NULL
```

**Node** representation in C

```c
typedef struct Node_t node {
  int value;
  struct node *next;
} Node_t;
```

Each element in the linked list will be represented as a **Node struct** that contains an *int* **value** and a ***struct Node_t** pointer* **\*next** that will point to the next node.

## We should be able to : 

1. Create the head of the list
2. Insert 
   1. a new node to the top of the list
   2. a new node at the bottom of the list
   3. a new node before a certain position of the list
   4. a new node after a certain position of the list
3. Print all elements of the linked-list
4. Delete
   1. the last node in the list
   2. the first node in the list
   3. the node at a certain position of the list

## Implementation

### 1. Creation 

We declare the first node to be the head of the list.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	head 
```

### 2. 1 Insertion at the top 

1. We create a new *node* and define it as the head

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	11 --> NULL
```

2. Every new element created will first point at the head address and then becomes the head

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	42 --> NULL
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	42 --> 11
	11 --> NULL
```

### 2.2 Insertion at the bottom

We parse all next values from the list until we reach NULL and then we affect the value of the last next element to the address of the new node

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	24 --> NULL
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	42:::someclass --> 11
	11:::someclass --> NULL
	classDef someclass fill:#5239ac;
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	42:::someclass --> 11
	11:::someclass --> 24
	24 --> NULL
	classDef someclass fill:#5239ac;
```

### 2.3 Insertion before a certain position

We want to insert node 99 before node 24.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	99 --> NULL
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	42 --> 11
	11:::active --> 24
	24 --> NULL
	classDef someclass fill:#169b1f;
	classDef active fill:#c82626;
	
```

First we must get the address of the <span style="color:#c82626">predecessor (11)</span> of the <span style="color:#169b1f">node (24)</span> where we want to make insertion. 

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	42 --> 11
	11:::active --> 24
	24:::someclass --> NULL
	99 --> 24
	classDef someclass fill:#169b1f;
	classDef active fill:#c82626;
```

Then we assign the next pointer value of the new node (99) to the <span style="color:#c82626">next pointer value of the predecessor (11)</span>. 

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	42 --> 11
	11:::active --> 99
	24:::someclass --> NULL
	99 --> 24
	classDef someclass fill:#169b1f;
	classDef active fill:#c82626;
```

Finally the <span style="color:#c82626">next pointer from predecessor (11)</span> points to the address of the new node (99). 

### 2.4 Insertion after a certain position

We want to insert node 101 after node 99

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	101 --> NULL
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	42 --> 11
	11:::active --> 99
	24:::someclass --> NULL
	99:::current --> 24
	classDef current fill:#169b1f;
	classDef next fill:#c82626;
```

First we get the address of the <span style="color:#169b1f">node 99</span> where we want to make insertion after. 

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	42 --> 11
	11:::active --> 99
	24:::next --> NULL
	99:::current --> 24
	101 --> 24
	classDef current fill:#169b1f;
	classDef next fill:#c82626;
```

Then we assign the <span style="color:#c82626">next pointer</span> value of the <span style="color:#169b1f">node 99Â </span>to the next pointer value of the new node 101. 

```mermaid
flowchart LR
	42 --> 11
	11:::active --> 99
	24:::next --> NULL
	99:::current --> 101
	101 --> 24
	classDef current fill:#169b1f;
	classDef next fill:#c82626;
```



Finally the <span style="color:#169b1f">next pointer of the node 99</span> needs to point to the address of the new node 101.
